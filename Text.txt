My Performance Goals – 6-Month Feedback

Lead successful delivery of SATS for Monthly CPI

Successfully led the deployment of SATS into the CPI environments (DEV, PPD, and PROD).

UAT testing resulted in very few bugs, and any issues identified were resolved promptly.

Discussed the severity of vulnerabilities identified during X-Ray scanning with the security team and documented the decisions to prevent delays in the production deployment.

Communicated effectively with stakeholders and sought support when needed to ensure smooth progress.

Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitLab

Implemented automated test suites to run regression and progression tests for every merge request promoted to protected branches.

This helped prevent incorrect code from being deployed to higher environments.

Automate deployment processes to improve efficiency

Worked on automating deployment processes to reduce manual effort, increase efficiency, and minimize rework.

Maintain clear and comprehensive technical documentation

Contributed to documenting the release and backup processes for SATS.

Assisted Annette in preparing the Security Architecture Document (SAD) by consolidating technical information and getting it endorsed by senior executives.

Propose and implement process or tool improvements

Participated in technical discussions with the Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) to identify process gaps and suggest improvements, including introducing suitable tools where needed.

Facilitate monthly team knowledge-sharing sessions

Supported weekly tech team catch-ups focused on knowledge sharing, discussing challenges, and finding collective solutions.

My Development Goals – 6-Month Feedback

Deepen knowledge of ABS processes, principles, and best practices

Gained a stronger understanding of ABS deployment processes and security best practices, particularly around securing DynamoDB data using proper encryption keys and applying the principle of least privilege.

Advance proficiency in TypeScript and Python

Improved skills in both TypeScript and Python through continuous learning and hands-on project work.

Build expertise in DevOps tools and practices

Strengthened DevOps expertise by resolving issues related to sourcing JDemetra binaries from open-source platforms like GitHub after a key team member’s departure.

Leverage ABS internal resources for continuous learning

Collaborated effectively with cross-functional teams to make better use of internal resources and improve understanding of ABS processes.

My Corporate and Cultural Contribution – 6-Month Feedback

Promote a collaborative and inclusive team culture

Encouraged a culture where every team member’s opinion is valued.

Ensured that technical solutions were discussed collectively, allowing everyone to contribute before final decisions were made.

Participate in ABS community initiatives and working groups

While I haven’t yet actively participated in ABS community initiatives, I plan to increase my involvement in the coming year.

I also aim to expand my network within ABS and gain more experience in mentoring and coaching others.
